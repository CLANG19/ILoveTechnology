Technology does fantastic and amazing wonders such as self driving cars and getting us into space for possible expansion of human life. Technology has made it possible for someone to
put on a virtual reality headset and be sent into a completely new world or even view places on Earth that you have never been to because you're too busy. Technology has made it possible
for people missing limbs to have new ones that are constantly getting better and better and closer to the real thing. Technology has and will forever assist humans in massive projects 
and creations never thought possible by humans.
